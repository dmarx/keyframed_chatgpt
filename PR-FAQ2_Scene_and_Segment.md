The `Scene` class is a container for `Segment` objects, and allows users to manage a collection of Keyframed parameters in a flexible and intuitive way.

The `Segment` class is a lightweight wrapper around a `Keyframed` object, and allows users to layer multiple `Segment` objects on top of one another to build a scene. The `Segment` class also provides additional functionality such as the ability to specify a start and end frame, and to loop or repeat the `Segment`.

Here are some potential use cases for the `Scene` and `Segment` classes:

- Creating an animation: the `Scene` class allows users to manage a timeline of Keyframed parameters, such as position, rotation, and scale, for an object in an animation. Each `Segment` in the `Scene` can be used to specify the Keyframed parameters for a specific part of the animation.
- Creating a music visualizer: the `Scene` class can be used to manage a timeline of Keyframed parameters, such as color, size, and shape, for visual elements in a music visualizer. Each `Segment` in the `Scene` can be used to specify the Keyframed parameters for a specific part of the music.
- Creating a video game: the `Scene` class can be used to manage a timeline of Keyframed parameters, such as camera position, character movement, and environmental effects, for a video game. Each `Segment` in the `Scene` can be used to specify the Keyframed parameters for a specific part of the game.

Here are some potential future improvements/features for the `Scene` and `Segment` classes:

- Adding the ability to specify transitions between `Segment` objects: users should be able to specify how the `Scene` transitions from one `Segment` to the next, such as using a smooth crossfade or a hard cut.
- Adding the ability to specify dependencies between `Segment` objects: users should be able to specify that one `Segment` depends on the values of another Segment, allowing them to create more complex interactions between different Keyframed parameters.
- Adding the ability to specify events or triggers in the `Scene`: users should be able to specify events or triggers that occur at specific points in the Scene, such as playing a sound or triggering an effect.
